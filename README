<h1>Read me!</h1>
<p>I'm finally finished. The first time I saw something like this, Reference didn't seem difficult, but it was difficult! Thank you youtube and me for your hard work.</p>


<p>In my code, I separate the files for HTML, CSS(Header.css ,footer.css,content.css,...), and JS. To keep myself from being confused while working.</p>


Thanks to Web Dev Creative Chanel on Youtube for the JS.
