# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

The technical I use in this project is very basic just HTML CSS and JS only.
I'm finally finished. The first time I saw something like this, the Reference didn't seem HARD, but it was HARD!
In my code, I separate the files for HTML, CSS(Header.css,footer.css,content.css,...), and JS. To keep myself from being confused while working.
